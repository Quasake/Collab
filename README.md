# About
> Creator: Frank Alfano

I created this game as a mini-project so I could learn more about Unity. The entire game up to this point has taken me about 2 months to complete. The game unfortunately is only compatable with [USB SNES controllers](https://www.walmart.com/ip/2-Pack-Classic-SNES-USB-Controller-Gamepad-iNNEXT-USB-PC-Wired-Game-Controller-Joysticks-for-Windows-PC-MAC-Linux-Retro-Pie/123050310?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=13020&adid=22222222227307607253&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=381293052190&wl4=pla-814971603516&wl5=9003709&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=120820835&wl11=online&wl12=123050310&veh=sem&gclid=CjwKCAiA5o3vBRBUEiwA9PVzaqzJxkd57LYSh2J-_ZOTjUHsD1hpYGpB9p98-Vmw1OxfHorRrKI5RRoC0IkQAvD_BwE "2 Pack Classic SNES USB Controller Gamepad") currently, and this is only because I had them sitting around and wanted to put them to use. In the future I would definitely make it compatable with a keyboard and mouse or even other game controllers.

# Game Info
***Collab* is a 2D 2-player puzzle platforming game that requires both players to work together to reach the end of the levels.**

There are 4 different modes that the players can become while playing the game to help them solve the puzzles:

- *Normal Mode* - The normal mode, as the name suggests, has no special abilities. This is the starting mode for both players at the beginning of every level.
- *Boost Mode* - This mode allows a player to jump higher than any other mode.
- *Shrink Mode* - The shrink mode allows a player to shrink down to be half of its height in order to fit into smaller gaps. While shrunken, the player also has a decreased jump height.
- *Swap Mode* - Swap mode allows a player to trade positions with the other player. This can be effective because the other player remains with the same powerup.

Now, this game would not be very challenging if both players could change into each of the 4 modes. That is why there is a rule that each player can only change into certain powerups in each level. For example, Player 1 could only be able to change into the *Boost Mode*, whereas Player 2 would be able to change into *Shrink Mode* and *Swap Mode*. Both players will never be in the same mode, with the exception of the *Normal Mode*. Each level also has a certain amount of times the players can change their mode. The means that the players need to be more strategic and work together rather than doing everything themselves. These 2 rules combine to form a challenging yet fun experience.

There are 5 main obstacles currently in the game that creates the puzzles: 

- *Levers* - Levers are used to open and close doors, and are toggles using the "B" button on the gamepad. The levers are connected to doors through a series of wires which gives the players a visual hint as to what the levers do.
- *Doors* - As stated, doors are opened and closed through levers, and allow the player to get into new areas once opened.
- *Spikes* - Spikes are dangerous because if the player touches them, they go back to the beginning to the level. They can be strategically placed to make certain levels more challenging.
- *Small Corridors* - Small corridors are only able to be passed in the player has shrunken down to half its size with the *Shrink Mode*.
- *High Ledges* - High ledges are only able to be passed by a player who has the *Boost Mode* equipped. Any other mode cannot jump high enough to get over them.

The more of these obstacles that are in a level, the harder and more intricate they become, which is how I was able to make the levels get harder and harder over time.

> This is the titlescreen when the game is first launched. The "Play" button takes you to the level selection screen (duh), the "Options" button takes you to an options screen where you can change the music volume and other settings, the "Credits" button displays the credits for the game (which are also listed below), and the "Quit" button quits the game.

> This is the level selection screen that appears when the "Play" button is pressed on the titlescreen. Currently there are 10 levels, each of them getting harder and harder to complete. The level button appears gold when you have completed that level, and the delete save button resets your progress.

> This is an example of a level, which happens to be Level 3. The players will need to navigate their way to reach the end of the level. The number in the top left is the number of mode switches the players have left.
