# About
This game was made as a mini-project I wanted to make so I could learn more about Unity. The entire game up to this point has taken me about 2 months to complete. The game unfortunately is only compatable with USB SNES controllers (which can be found [here](https://www.walmart.com/ip/2-Pack-Classic-SNES-USB-Controller-Gamepad-iNNEXT-USB-PC-Wired-Game-Controller-Joysticks-for-Windows-PC-MAC-Linux-Retro-Pie/123050310?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=13020&adid=22222222227307607253&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=381293052190&wl4=pla-814971603516&wl5=9003709&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=120820835&wl11=online&wl12=123050310&veh=sem&gclid=CjwKCAiA5o3vBRBUEiwA9PVzaqzJxkd57LYSh2J-_ZOTjUHsD1hpYGpB9p98-Vmw1OxfHorRrKI5RRoC0IkQAvD_BwE "2 Pack Classic SNES USB Controller Gamepad")) currently, and this is only because I had them sitting around and wanted to put them to use.

# Game Info
*Collab* is a 2D 2-player puzzle platforming game that requires both players to work together to reach the end of the levels.

There are 4 different modes that the players can become while playing the game to help them solve the puzzles:

- *Normal Mode* - The normal mode, as the name suggests, has no special abilities. This is the starting mode for both players at the beginning of every level.
- *Boost Mode* - This mode allows a player to jump higher than any other mode.
- *Shrink Mode* - The shrink mode allows a player to shrink down to be half of its height in order to fit into smaller gaps. While shrunken, the player also has a decreased jump height.
- *Swap Mode* - Swap mode allows a player to trade positions with the other player. This can be effective because the other player remains with the same powerup.

Now, this game would not be very challenging if both players could change into each of the 4 modes. That is why there is a rule that each player can only change into certain powerups in each level. For example, Player 1 could only be able to change into the *Boost Mode*, whereas Player 2 would be able to change into *Shrink Mode* and *Swap Mode*. Both players will never be in the same mode, with the exception of the *Normal Mode*. Each level also has a certain amount of times the players can change their mode. The means that the players need to be more strategic and work together rather than doing everything themselves. These 2 rules combine to form a challenging yet fun experience.
